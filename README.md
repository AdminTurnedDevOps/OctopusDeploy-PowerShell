# OctopusDeploy-PowerShell
OctopusDeploy-PowerShell is PowerShell scripts wrapped around the Octopus Deploy REST API.

# Why OctopusDeploy-PowerShell?
One thing that I have heard from everyone I know that uses Octopus. It is very "clicky" or for "people who don't want to code". With that in mind, I wanted to make it PowerShell friendly. Now individuals who code in PowerShell can interact with Octopus with code.
